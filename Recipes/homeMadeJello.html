    <h2>How to Make Healthy Homemade Jello</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of juice (See <a href="#notes">notes</a> )</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unflavored beef gelatin</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp honey or agave (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 1/2-3/4 cup of the juice to a bowl or liquid measuring cup and sprinkle with gelatin powder.</li>
        <li>Whisk together to combine and allow to sit for 3-5 minutes to "bloom." The granules will plump and the
            mixture will look like very thick applesauce or take on a lumpy appearance.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining (3 1/4- 3 1/2 cups) juice into a medium saucepan. Heat over medium heat until almost
            boiling.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in honey (if using) and the bloomed gelatin mixture. Stir to dissolve.</li>
        <li>Pour into an 8x8 (2 quart) baking dish for thick Jello or a 9x13" baking dish for thin Jello, or into
            individual glasses or jars for individual portions.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate about 4 hours, or until set. (If you've used a 9x13 pan, it may be set in as little as 2 hours)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a id="notes">Notes</a></h4>
    <p>*You must use unflavored beef gelatin for this recipe, not protein powder, collagen, or gelatin-based protein
        powders. ONLY gelatin will work.</p>
